- Interstitial journaling is an incredibly simple journaling process [created by  Tony Stubblebine](https://medium.com/better-humans/replace-your-to-do-list-with-interstitial-journaling-to-increase-productivity-4e43109d15ef), that essentially involves just capturing a timestamp whenever you take a break, and logging what you just did and what you are working on next in a few sentences.
- It is really easy to get started with, and is a nice alternative to proper time tracking, and allows for flexibility and adaptability while still having something to keep you [artificially accountable](https://aengusmcmillin.com/artificial-accountability).
- I use almost exactly the same approach as [outlined by Anne-Laure on NessLabs](https://nesslabs.com/interstitial-journaling)

Check out the [[Books]] I am reading

Or maybe my [[Writing Ideas]]?

I'm also using this as a knowledgebase for [[What I Know]]

This is very much a work in progress. I will try and format more content for here as I get used to this system and think of things I want to share publicly.

I'm also working on improving the styling of course, will figure out previews of linked references as soon as possible, and if possible I would like to do more interactions in terms of opening multiple notes at the same time as well.

This is all built as a [[Gatsby Theme]]. You can find the source and npm package installation instructions on [GitHub](https://github.com/aengusmcmillin/gatsby-theme-brain)
